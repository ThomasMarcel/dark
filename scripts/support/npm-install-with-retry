# we believe it was a `yarn` issue. We've kept it to be on the cautious side. It can be removed in the future if we find
# it indeed wasn't necessary.

# Note, *not* set -e, we explicitly want to loop if/when npm install fails
# and don't want the script to fail. The set +e is unnecessary as it's the
# default, but putting it in to ensure nobody attempts to improve the script
# by adding set -e
